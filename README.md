## 🚀 Introduction  

Cybersecurity audits are critical checkpoints for assessing an organization's security posture. However, they often come with challenges—misaligned objectives, resource constraints, and gaps between **InfoSec** and **internal audit** teams.  

The **Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA)** introduced the **Cybersecurity Topical Requirement** in its **2024 Global Internal Audit Standards** to improve cybersecurity audits by ensuring:  
✅ Consistent methodologies  
✅ Collaboration between audit and InfoSec teams  
✅ Enhanced transparency of security controls  

This guide provides a **step-by-step approach** to navigating cybersecurity audits under the new requirement.

## 🔍 Understanding The IIA’s Cybersecurity Topical Requirement  

The **Cybersecurity Topical Requirement** is a framework ensuring internal auditors evaluate cybersecurity with **structured, consistent methodologies**. It focuses on **three key areas**:  

### 🔹 Governance  
📌 Establishing cybersecurity policies aligned with frameworks like **NIST CSF, COBIT, and ISO 27001**.  
📌 Defining roles and responsibilities within the organization.  
📌 Ensuring board-level oversight of cybersecurity risks.  

### 🔹 Risk Management  
📌 Conducting structured **cyber risk assessments**.  
📌 Ensuring **incident response and disaster recovery** plans exist.  
📌 Managing third-party cybersecurity risks.  

### 🔹 Controls  
📌 Implementing **secure access management, encryption, and monitoring**.  
📌 Protecting **endpoints, networks, and cloud environments**.  
📌 Enforcing **secure development lifecycle (SDLC) principles**.  

📌 **Key Benefit:** Aligns cybersecurity audits with established risk management frameworks, reducing inconsistencies and gaps.
